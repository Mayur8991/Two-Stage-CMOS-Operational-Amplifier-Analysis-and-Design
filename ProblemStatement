Two-Stage Operational Amplifier at 1 um technology. 

If KN’=120μA/V2, KP’= 25μA/V2, VTN = |VTP| = 0.5, λn= 0.06V-1, and λp = 
0.08V-1, Design a two-stage, CMOS op amp that meets the following specifications. 
Assume the channel length is to be 1μm and the load capacitor is CL = 10pF. 

Note: For 1um design consider the standard model used in the lab.

The useful formula and tentative circuit diagram for calculation unknown parameters is 
described below: 

(A) Calculate sizing of each transistor and mention the values in the final circuit. 
(B) AC Response (dB vs Frequency)  
(C) Transient Response 
(D) Prepare the table for obtained simulated results vs given specification.
